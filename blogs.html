                Toastmasters Amrita Bengaluru is one of the most dynamic clubs of the college. I took up my position as President of the club right when the entire world went into a lockdown. It was a transitioning period from offline meetings to completely online meetings. Major challenge was to warm up the club members to circumstances which are poles apart. Nevertheless the club has always managed to stir in the right direction with the help of the right mentors. The term was extremely successful in terms of motivation of the members, membership count, DCP and the awards. I owe most of it to my team which had put in a lot of hardwork and effort in bringing the club to a point of self sustenance. <br><br>  

                A college club is in fact very different from a corporate and community club. One major factor being the members. The members of a college club are college going students who are incredibly energetic and enthusiastic. To give a more fancy analogy it is like dealing with a live ball of fire. We will have to guide them to channel the energy into the right direction, just so that they get the best out of everything. Being a leader in a club which has both seniors and juniors was a healthy challenge. The club environment was made very positive and extremely nurturing to the members. This also helped in establishing a robust relationship between the members and between the leadership team. <br><br>

                One of the perks of being a college club is, everyone is in the same age bracket. Thus the thinking, perspectives and way of handling things are more or less similar. This aided a lot in the smooth functioning of the club and propelled us to get the highest possible awards. <br><br>

                Toastmasters Amrita Bengaluru is one of the most dynamic clubs of the college and will probably remain the same till the end.

                I kept falling<br>
                Into depths unknown,<br>
                As things went down spiraling<br>
                I heard a voice, my own.<br>
                Whether it was my true calling<br>
                Or just a desperate moan,<br>
                I set about crawling<br>
                To catch a glimpse of that which shone!<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                The world of today is rapidly progressing, towards extremities. The rich get richer and poor get poorer, in almost every way. With innumerable summits hosted by superpower nations; world leaders brainstorming to bring us all together as one; countless proposals being made day in and out to eradicate poverty, illiteracy, disease, war, discrimination and oppression, we are still a developing world and will always be. <br><br>
                Scaling this down to an individual level, each one of us goes through an array of experiences and emotions in a time period as short as a day. We host internal and external dialogues and debates, discuss with mentors about career options, finalize investment plans, track productivity and go on guilt trips for gifting ourselves some leisure time. <br><br>
                Talking to my parents and grandparents has always strengthened an opinion of mine. We, the younger generation, have convinced ourselves of behavioral patterns advocating extreme mindsets. We walk the paths of ‘immersion’ and ‘obsession’. On the other hand, I have always heard stories of patience and persistence at home. I have come to believe with experience that with the plethora of ready-made options, the youth today has drifted tangential to the path of perseverance. Wait, how does this relate to balance?<br><br>
                In the poem above, imagine yourself as the character spiraling down a tunnel of hardships. You fell into it from a brightly lit place of comfort. You stretched yourself initially, but this journey now seems longer than anticipated. You reassured yourself of the light at the end of the tunnel and kept going. No, you haven’t reached the other side yet, you haven’t slept or eaten in days and are tired. Mustering all your courage, you decided that this has to be it. You will now go, to the brightly lit place of comfort.<br><br> 
                Pause and reflect, did you imagine going forward into the tunnel or going back to your start point. Your answer coupled with the point of this piece is an insight into your mindset. Are you being persistent and establishing a balance or are you letting go midway and slipping into the existing extremity? If each of us makes a conscious effort to calm the internal conflict down, to know when to jump in and when to let go, to know what to gather and what to donate; if we attain the ultimate understanding that light and darkness are directed by the tunnels we pass through and that each precedes the other, we in turn become instruments that drive the world from rapidly-progressing-towards-extremities to gradually-gaining-balance. The entire act of developing the world, would be inside out, spearheaded more by individuals and less by governments. <br><br>
                And in that lies true strength. The strength to smile at an obstacle and silently challenge it, knowing that this is the infectious radiance you let out, one that can attract groups and stir a positive change!
