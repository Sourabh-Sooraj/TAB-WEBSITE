                  <p>I entered and My day was made with the energy, enthusiasm and enigma that each TABster has.
                    TAB is the only college club of Division G so if we consider age wise they shall be the youngest in the Division but as they say, leadership and communication come from practice and not age. Most of the mentors, coaches, LDPians, ADs, Division council members are from TAB. They are mentoring so many corporate club members, helping them become better leaders and communicators.
                    Thank you TAB for adding the brightest shade of colours to the canvas of Division G.

                  <p>I still remember the first day I attended TAB's session. I was dragged to the meeting by our very own Division Director as she said it's the only collegiate club of Division G. Belonging to a corporate Toastmasters club, I was expecting the meeting to go on very formally with little to no interaction among the members as it was an online meeting.
                    But the turn of events as the session progressed was something I was least expecting when I agreed to attend a Toastmasters meeting, that too on a weekend!  The energy and enthusiasm of the TABsters was unparalleled to any other club session I had attended in the past. With quality speakers and very active members, I didn't feel like I wasted even one second of my time there. In fact, it transported me back to my college days and it was fun to relive the experience!
                    I soon became a regular attendee of the weekend sessions of TAB and it feels like I've known the members since a long time, even if we never met in real life.
                    I just wish the best for Toastmasters Amrita Bengaluru and as the President of the club says, don't stop aiming for the stars! :)

                  <p>I attended my first TAB meeting sometime in April 2020, to remind myself about college and get nostalgic about the good old days I spent in Amrita Bengaluru during 2014-18. Little did I know that the meeting would make me fall in love with the club's culture and people! I have been a regular Guest in their meetings for months now and they always leave me wanting for more.
                    Amongst the many clubs that I have visited so far in my Toastmasters journey, I find TAB to be the most dynamic, passionate and inspiring club. TAB strives to do better with every single meeting, and they often leave people in awe. Despite being the only college club in the Division, TAB is giving the other good-standing clubs a run for their money.
                    I regret not being a member of TAB in my college days. Having said that, I am happy it has turned out to be my second home now!

                  <p>Did you ever see the enthusiasm, energy, innovation, hard-work, fun, and many more such things put together? If the answer is No, then you must definitely visit this club filled with energetic, enthusiastic, and talented youngsters called TAB!!
                    TABsters are those people who have always left me awestruck with the way they innovate their meetings and make them very interesting. I have also always been amazed by the way they deliver their speeches and come up with new initiatives to keep their members motivated. These people have the capability of re-energizing anyone like us who have hectic work schedules, with their fun-filled meetings. I always reminisce about my college days, those days of one-day batting, combined studies, fun filled bus journeys, and whatnot. The people of that age usually like to spend time chilling out with friends, watching movies and things like that. But these people have put their heart and soul into Toastmasters in order to mold themselves into their best versions every day. Everyone in this bunch of power-packed teams has a killing instinct to do something new and achieve more and more.
                    I would like to say that choosing Toastmasters at this very right age is one of the best decisions they have ever taken, which would help them to be job-ready and to face any other challenges in life.
                    I wish them all the very best for their future and hope they do more and more wonders like this as a team!

Little did I then know, that my journey of self-development would help me unravel unexpected secrets to happiness, the joy in working as a team, the pleasure in networking with like-minded enthusiasts, the unity in staying stuck through lows and highs and many more.
                    I hold TAB really close to my heart and will forever be grateful for being associated with the club. The members, the general mood of the group and the experiences I have here, have helped me grow and bloom in numerous aspects of my personal and professional life; I am sure I can say this on behalf of every TAB-ster that the encouragement, love and support that are found here in abundance is what draws us back time and again to each other.

Through TAB meetings I've always learnt something new. I Feel the meetings and the process that goes into conducting one is a great way of learning and evolving in Public Speaking. It also helps in personality development and inculcating interpersonal skills. TAB is doing a really great job and I really did enjoy and cherish each and every meeting I've attended so far!

                  <p>Personally, I have a strong love for India. It feels very special and uplifting that I was invited to TAB. I have visited two of TAB’s online meetings so far. One was a regular meeting. Another was the Club Officer Installation and a panel discussion. At first glance, I was very shocked to see the number of people gathered. Lots of young people were joining and enthusiastically taking part in the meeting. Another surprising thing is that all of the role takers knew each other well so that while introducing the following role taker, they mention his/her personal achievements along with fun facts about them. After the second meeting for the installation of the club officers, the  Area Director came and officiated the ceremony. Normally,  the AD is not regular and usually doesn't know much about each person. But the ceremony disproved my stereotypical way of thinking and gave me a personal golden nugget as I am taking up the positionof Area Director in District 93. There definitely seems to be lots of things that I can learn in terms of proceedings of the meeting. I highly recommend TAB for its professional meetings in terms of language use and role taking and friendliness. All the best and kudos to TAB.

        This is not entirely true. People gather together and take up different roles and gradually, yet surely improve their soft skills, which includes a person’s hold over the English language, since it is the primary language used in a Toastmasters meeting.

        English being the secondary language for a lot of people all around the world, Toastmasters is definitely not just for people who know English. In fact, there are Toastmasters clubs in the languages you want. If there is not one already, it can even be chartered, if you wish to take the initiative, or if you express that you would like to have one in your language!

        No one in a Toastmasters meeting will force you to speak if you do not wish to. However, we would love it if you could introduce yourself so that we may give you a good welcome to the meeting! And, if you wish to take the leap of faith and you want to talk at any point during the meeting, the stage would be yours for the ta(l)king!
